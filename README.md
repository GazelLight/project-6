**Getting investments**


I've decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so my partners and I decided to try and attract investors. They're interested in the current market conditions, they wonder I'll be able to maintain my success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?

my partners have asked me to prepare some market research, by using the open-source data on restaurants in LA that I have.
